# ðŸ’« Pharma Supply Chain

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain, implementing a pharmaceutical supply chain system using Solidity smart contracts. It is developed for educational and experimental purposes, aiming to showcase the functionality of a supply chain solution but is not intended for real-world use cases.

## Disclaimer

This project is currently under development and may not be feature-complete or free from bugs. It is important to note that this project is not suitable for production deployment or handling real-world pharmaceutical supply chain operations. It is solely for learning and demonstration purposes.
